Even though the coaching institute is satisfied with the current state of the project, we are constantly trying to improve the project by making everything customizable and making the admin self-sufficient to make changes to website without involving the developer.
As of now,  the admin is capable of adding/removing new students, update study materials and modify notice board. We are looking for ways to make admin

- add or remove webpages and add content to the webpage
- update marks and other information related to a student
